Hello there!

I'm Lukas, a cybersecurity master's student based in Kaunas, Lithuania.

I create tools to make the daily tasks easier.

I have worked in an esports production team for multiple years, where I automated dedicated server deployment and created multiple in-game HUDs, which provided a more immersive experience for the viewer.

My main tech stack is React, TypeScript, Sass, Lua, and some others... My current goal is to improve on the OOP languages, for example, C++. You may notice new projects popping up based on C or C++ languages on my GitHub profile.

I'm currently working as a UI developer for game projects.
